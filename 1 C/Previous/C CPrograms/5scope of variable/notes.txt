scope=lifetime

strict definition: a block or a region where a variable is defined and used and when a block or a region ends, variable is automatically destroyed

basic principles of scoping

{
    ...
    {
    ...             // contents of outer block upto this point are vivible to the iternal block & contents of inner block is not vivible to outer block
    }
}
.....................................
{

}
                  //contents of this block is not visible to any block outside this block
{

}

note. 
1. when we write extern some_datatype some_variable_name; no memory is allocated only property is announced 

2. multiple declarationd  of extern variable  is allowed eithin the file .This is not the case with automatic variables.

3. extern variables says to compiler "go outside from my scope and you will find the definition of the variables 

4. compiler belives that weather the extern variable said is true and poduce no error. Linker throws an error when he finds n such variable exists 
5. when an extern variable is initialized , then memory forthis vaiable is allocated and it will be o=cinsidered defined
