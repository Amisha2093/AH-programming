**Sequence Containers: implement data structures that can be accessed in a sequential manner.


1. vector
2. list
3. deque
4. arrays
5. forward_list( Introduced in C++11)

**Container Adaptors: provide a different interface for sequential containers.
queue

1. priority_queue
2. stack


** Associative Containers: implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity).
4. set
5. multiset
6. map
7. multimap

**Unordered Associative Containers: implement unordered data structures that can be quickly searched

1. unordered_set (Introduced in C++11)
2. unordered_multiset (Introduced in C++11)
3. unordered_map (Introduced in C++11)
4. unordered_multimap (Introduced in C++11)
